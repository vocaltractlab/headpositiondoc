Visual Assessment Protocol
__________________________

Visually assessing imaging studies the predictive models found are borderline requires two raters to visually agree on the head position following the below protocol.


Flexion
~~~~~~~
	
When the c-spine is curved forward with a 'c' shape and the ANS/PNS plane is sloping anterior-inferior. Additionally, look at the 3D rendering to visually assess the canthomeadal angle (See following picture), which is the angle that subtended by the canthomeatal line, defined as the line from the outer canthus of the eye to the midpoint of the external auditory meatus, and a line perpendicular to the table/scanner. The angle should be less than -10. 

Extension
~~~~~~~~~

When the c-spine is curved posterior and the ANS/PNS plane is sloping anterior-superior. Additionally, look at the 3D rendering to visually assess the canthomeadal angle, which should be greater than 20 degrees.

Neutral
~~~~~~~

When the c-spine is straight with a slight extension in C7 and the ANS/PNS plane is horizontal. In the 3D rendering the canthomeadal angle should be between -10 to 20 degrees and optimally 0 degrees.

Neutral - Flexion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These scans are complex with two potential positions that can be classified into this group. The scan would be in a flexed neck and a neutral face plane or a neutral neck and a flexed face plane. These cases in 3D will look close to neutral.

Neutral - Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These scans are complex with two potential positions that can be classified into this group. The scan would be in an extended neck and a neutral face plane or a neutral neck and an extended face plane. These cases in 3D look close to neutral.

Flexion - Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These scans are complex with two potential positions that can be classified into this group. The scan would be in an extended neck and flexed face plane or a flexed neck and an extended face plane.
