Overview
========

Following is the documentation to use multiple measures to classify head position. 

Background
----------
The `Vocal Tract Development Lab <http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/vocal>`_ at the Waisman Center developed a protocol that quantitatively and qualitatively classifies head position in medical images (CT/MRI) as flexed, neutral, or extended. Confidently classifying head position is vital to conducting analysis of the head and neck. Dynamic and potentially contradictory mobility of the face plan and the neck require methods that use more than one measure.  The following protocol utilizes 17 measurements of the head and neck to determine the classification of flexed, neutral, or extended.  Additionally due to the dual hybrid methods neutral-flexed and neutral-extension cases can be identified as well.

The development of this head position classification protocol will be published in Orthodontics & Craniofacial Research. The article can be accessed `here <http://>`__.

General
-------
The training dataset for the head position classification protocol consists of MRI scans from six participants in five different head positions; extension, flexion, neutral with open mouth, neutral with closed mouth, and neutral with standardized open mouth.  All scans were collected prospectively at University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics.
