The head position protocol was developed as a tool to aid future researchers in the goal of classifying the head position of medical imaging studies. This project started in the `Vocal Tract Development Lab <http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/vocal>`_, Waisman Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under the supervision of VTLab Director and Principal Investigator `Dr. Houri K. Vorperian <http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/pi-Vorperian-Houri.htm>`_.

The refinement of this head position protocol and development of this documentation are the direct outcomes of Courtney Miller's efforts, with valuable collaboration with Yen Lee and Dr. Gregory Avey. Additionally, Kelli Hellenbrand and Julie Eichhorn assisted with recruitment and running participants to collect the medical imaging scans for the training dataset used in this protocol. The development of this head position protocol also benefited from the valuable input from: Katelyn Tillman, Helen Werner, Meghan Cotter, Ying Ji Chuang, Gabrial Jardim, Nathan Bollig, Diane Austin and Moo Chung.
